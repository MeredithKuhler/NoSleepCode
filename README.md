Project Idea: Office Automation System for PediatricDoctor’s Office

This project will involve system analysis, design, implementation, and testing of an Office Automation System for Pediatric Doctor’s Office. This system will be used by doctors, nurses, and patients (or parents/guardians). Main objective of this software system is to reduce the paperwork and also increase the accessibility of patient records. Ideally, this system should be accessible through the web as well as using a mobile app. However, for the CSE 360 class project, you will be developing a GUI based desktop application using javaFX (that you have learned in CSE 205). The following section explains the system operation and expected functionality

System Operation:

When a patient comes to visit the doctor, first, meet and greet the office staff nurse. The nurse will take vitals such as weight, height, body temperature, and blood pressure if the patient is over 12 and entered into the system associated with the visit.
Then the patient will be escorted into the examination room where he/she will be examined by the doctor. Before the doctor’s arrival, the nurse will ask specific questions related to the health of the patient such as known alleges, any health concerns and entered into the system. At this time, the nurse will be able to see the patient’s history including previous health issues, previously prescribed medications, and history of immunization.
Once the patient is ready to be examined by the doctor, the doctor will do a physical test and enter any findings to the system. If any medication needs to be prescribed, the prescription will be entered into the system as well as the prescription will be sent to the pharmacy listed in the patient’s records.
The doctor will be able to see the patient’s history including previous health issues, previously prescribed medications, and history of immunization and any other recommendations will be made. The patient portal of the system allows the user to create an account in the system. 
Each patient is uniquely identified in the system using the patient's first name, last name, and the birthday combination. The patient will be able to see and change contact information entered. Also, patients can see the summary of each patient visit.
Also, patients can send messages to the doctor/nurse with specific health related questions. When the nurse or the doctor see a message sent by a patient, they can reply via email or through the patient portal. If urgent, they will make a phone call to the patient. In addition to health-related information, this office automation system stores patient’s contact information, insurance information, and pharmacy information.
